  This component is responsible for provisioning an
  [AWS Inspector](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/user/what-is-inspector.html) by installing the
  [Inspector agent](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/set-up-amazon-inspector) across all EC2 instances and applying the
  Inspector rules.

  AWS Inspector is a security assessment service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It helps you analyze and evaluate
  the security and compliance of your applications and infrastructure deployed on AWS. AWS Inspector automatically
  assesses the resources within your AWS environment, such as Amazon EC2 instances, for potential security vulnerabilities
  and deviations from security best practices.

  Here are some key features and functionalities of AWS Inspector:

  - **Security Assessments:** AWS Inspector performs security assessments by analyzing the behavior of your resources and
    identifying potential security vulnerabilities. It examines the network configuration, operating system settings, and
    installed software to detect common security issues.

  - **Vulnerability Detection:** AWS Inspector uses a predefined set of rules to identify common vulnerabilities,
    misconfigurations, and security exposures. It leverages industry-standard security best practices and continuously
    updates its knowledge base to stay current with emerging threats.

  - **Agent-Based Architecture:** AWS Inspector utilizes an agent-based approach, where you install an Inspector agent on
    your EC2 instances. The agent collects data about the system and its configuration, securely sends it to AWS
    Inspector, and allows for more accurate and detailed assessments.

  - **Security Findings:** After performing an assessment, AWS Inspector generates detailed findings that highlight
    security vulnerabilities, including their severity level, impact, and remediation steps. These findings can help you
    prioritize and address security issues within your AWS environment.

  - **Integration with AWS Services:** AWS Inspector seamlessly integrates with other AWS services, such as AWS
    CloudFormation, AWS Systems Manager, and AWS Security Hub. This allows you to automate security assessments, manage
    findings, and centralize security information across your AWS infrastructure.

# How to use this component
usage: |-
  Stack Level: Regional

  Example stack snippet:

  ```yaml
  components:
    terraform:
      aws-inspector:
        vars:
          enabled: true
          enabled_rules:
            - cis
  ```

  The `aws-inspector` component can be included in a Terraform stack configuration. In the example, it is enabled with `enabled: true`. The `enabled_rules` variable specifies a list of rules to enable and uses short forms (e.g., `cis`) that automatically resolve to the correct rule package ARN for the target region. See the `var.enabled_rules` input for available short forms.

  For a comprehensive list of rules and their corresponding ARNs, refer to the Amazon Inspector ARNs for rules packages documentation. Customize the configuration and enabled rules to tailor security assessments to your requirements and compliance standards.
