# High-level description of what this component does
description: |
  This component provisions AWS Inspector by installing the Inspector agent across all EC2 instances and applying Inspector rules.

  AWS Inspector is a security assessment service that analyzes and evaluates the security and compliance of applications and infrastructure on AWS. It automatically assesses resources such as Amazon EC2 instances for potential security vulnerabilities and deviations from best practices.

  Key features and functionality of AWS Inspector include:
  - Security assessments that analyze resource behavior and identify potential vulnerabilities by examining network configuration, OS settings, and installed software.
  - Vulnerability detection using predefined rules based on industry best practices, with a continuously updated knowledge base.
  - Agent-based architecture: an Inspector agent runs on EC2 instances to collect configuration data and enable accurate, detailed assessments.
  - Security findings that include severity, impact, and remediation steps to help prioritize issues.
  - Integration with other AWS services (e.g., CloudFormation, Systems Manager, Security Hub) to automate assessments, manage findings, and centralize security information.
# How to use this component
usage: |
  Stack Level: Regional

  Example stack snippet:

  ```yaml
  components:
    terraform:
      aws-inspector:
        vars:
          enabled: true
          enabled_rules:
            - cis
  ```

  The `aws-inspector` component can be included in a Terraform stack configuration. In the example, it is enabled with `enabled: true`. The `enabled_rules` variable specifies a list of rules to enable and uses short forms (e.g., `cis`) that automatically resolve to the correct rule package ARN for the target region. See the `var.enabled_rules` input for available short forms.

  For a comprehensive list of rules and their corresponding ARNs, refer to the Amazon Inspector ARNs for rules packages documentation. Customize the configuration and enabled rules to tailor security assessments to your requirements and compliance standards.
